            Colony records in his journal that James Everell and two other men observed moving lights 
            in the sky earlier that year. He described James as "sober" and "discreet", no doubt to 
            lend credibility to the sighting. He wrote that while James and his two boat mates rowed 
            their way up the Muddy River, they observed a great light in the night sky that darted 
            between them and the village of Charlestown, a distance of about two miles, for roughly 
            two to three hours. He added that “diverse other credible persons saw the same light, 
            after, about the same place." Many consider this to be "America's First UFO sighting".</p>

          altitude, of red or silver plated color, moving in formation at high speed, and untouched 
          by the AAA salvos. Their pace is an estimated 29000 km/h. There is also a larger object 
          which remains stationary for some time, then, when lightened by the projectors above Culver 
          City, starts to move at a constant speed of 100 km/h in the direction of the Santa Monica

        <time>July 26, 1947</time>&nbsp;<b>Washington, DC.</b><br>
        <a href="">NATIONAL SECURITY REORGANIZATION</a>
		Amid the flying saucer mayhem, the U.S. government passed
the National Security Act on July 26, 1947. This created a
unified National Military Establishment (NME), a National
Security Council (NSC) and a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
The reorganization had been in the making for several years.
The investment of time was not wasted—at least from the
perspective of the policymaking elite—as the Act was, by far,
the century’s most significant overhaul of the country’s national
security apparatus. It unified the armed services under the
authority of a Secretary of Defense, and scrapped the old,
more honest, title of Secretary of War. James Vincent Forrestal,
former Secretary of the Navy, became the nation’s first SecDef.
Forrestal himself had done much to sabotage the authority of
the new position. As navy secretary, he favored continued
independence of that service. Largely due to his efforts, each
service secretary—the army, the navy, and the newly established
air force—gained the right to appeal to the president regarding
crucial issues, such as budget allotments. The Act therefore
exacerbated interservice rivalries. Forrestal wanted a
coordinating, not executive, role for the position of Secretary of
Defense. To his eventual chagrin, he now acquired it.
55
The National Security Act also established a Central Intelligence
Agency. It prohibited the CIA from any “internal security
functions,” that is, from spying operations in the United States.
But it contained a huge loophole (written by future DCI Allen
Dulles) enabling the CIA “to perform such other functions and
duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the
National Security Council may from time to time direct.” This
quickly translated into carte blanche to carry out nearly any
mission it wished, wherever it wanted, without scrutiny from
Congress or, when necessary, the president.
Although the CIA still had no operational spending authority,
this was quickly overcome through a variety of subterranean
enterprises conducted globally. Intelligence agencies need money,
and lots of it. If one wishes to raise private armies for secret
wars around the world, or remove intractable national leaders
determined to forge policies independent of U.S. wishes, then
huge amounts of money become a necessity. Initially, much of
the CIA’s money seems to have come from wealthy Americans.
(As future CIA Operations Chief Frank Wisner put it, in
obtaining money for secret ventures “it is essential to secure
the overt cooperation of people with conspicuous access to
wealth in their own right,” in other words, people who are
rich.)
56 Soon, however, the CIA’s money came from two basic
sources: Congress (e.g., legitimate taxes, classified amounts of
which were distributed to the agency) and its ever-growing
number of private ventures, not all of which, to put the matter
mildly, were legal.

          Air Force Project Bluebook Oct 15 Incident</a><br>
		  On October 15, 1948, at approximately 11:05 PM, a two-man crew of a USAF F-61 Black Widow 
		  night-fighter was conducting a routine patrol roughly 50 miles northwest of Fukuoka over 
		  the Korea Strait.<br>
          <b>Radar Detection</b>:<br>
          The crew detected an unidentified target on their airborne interception radar. 
          The object was initially spotted five miles ahead of the aircraft, slightly below its altitude.
          Visual Sightings: Reports describe the object as a "rifle bullet" shaped craft, approximately 
          20 to 30 feet in length. Other descriptions characterized it as a glowing, disc-shaped object 
          that appeared to defy conventional physics.
          Flight Characteristics: The object demonstrated high-speed capabilities and elusive maneuvers, 
          eventually vanishing without a trace.<br>
          <b>Historical Significance:</b>
          Early Records: This event is recognized as one of the earliest unexplained radar-visual UFO 
          encounters documented by the U.S. military in post-war Japan.

          Radar Blips/Sightings of UFOs in Gulf of Mexico, off Louisiana coastline</a><br>
		  At approximately 5:24 AM on December 6, 1952, a B-29 crew was on a routine training 
		  mission about 100 miles south of the Louisiana coast when they encountered multiple 
		  unidentified objects.<br>
          <b>Radar Detection:</b><br>
          The bomber’s radar operators, led by Lieutenant Coleman, detected several high-speed 
		  blips on their scopes. The objects were clocked at speeds exceeding 5,000 miles per 
		  hour, far surpassing any known aircraft of 1952.<br>
          <b>Visual Confirmation</b>:<br>
          Crew members looking out of the bomber’s scanners reported seeing blue-white lights that 
		  moved with incredible speed, matching the radar tracks.<br>
          <b>Maneuvers</b>:<br>
          The objects reportedly converged on the B-29, slowed down to match its speed for a brief 
		  period, and then accelerated away. At one point, the radar showed a large "mother ship" 
		  blip that smaller objects appeared to merge into.

          "It is a huge and worthy work which needs to be urgently 
          carried out because the witnesses of year 54 start to seriously age (if they did not 
          already disappear!) and it is high time to question them again to compare their current 
          testimonies with their former one. I know several groups which wrote to me to announce 
          the startup of this work. One can only applaud and recommend that they remain careful 
          in their critical research and not to hesitate to put side to side the two different 
          versions, without judging by themselves which is the correct one. It would perhaps 
          unconsciously privilege the current tendencies of ufology... at the expense of the 
          historical truth, since nothing proves that the version currently given thirty years 
          after the facts and with the erosion of the memory is the right version of the events. 
          Thus it is best to juxtapose testimonies, letting to those who will read and study 
          these texts in the future the care to shape an opinion, for one must be very conscious 
          that this work is not for ourselves."<br>

		  The First Night: At approximately 6:45 PM on June 26, Gill observed a large, sparkling 
		  object with a "deck" on top. He noted four human-like figures performing tasks on the 
		  craft.<br>
          <b>The Interaction</b>:<br>
		  On the second night, June 27, the craft returned. Gill and his parishioners waved at the 
		  figures; the "men" on the craft reportedly waved back. When Gill signaled with a flashlight, 
		  the craft made a swinging motion in response.<br>
          <b>Craft Description</b>:<br>
		  The object was described as disk-shaped with a wide base, four "legs" or landing pads 
		  underneath, and four panels on the side that glowed more brightly than the rest of the 
		  craft.

          to see a large window on a craft, and inside are two ETs staring right at them.

        Three sailors in two boats were in the Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a 
        foreign submarine. Then, nearly a dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto 
        the “sub.” Moments later it rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer.

        Just before 8pm on Sep 15, 1962, three boys were shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, 
        plunge into the Oradell Reservoir in New Jersey, and takeoff. Unknown to them, others 
        saw the object. The next night, the UFO was back. Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly,

        The Shag Harbour UFO Incident</a><br>
        Shag Harbour UFO is Canada’s equivalent of the Roswell UFO in the United States. On 
        October 4, 1967, an unknown object crashed into the water near the tiny fishing village 
        of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. At least 11 people watched the object as it headed towards 
        the harbor. Multiple witnesses heard a whistling sound and a loud bang as it crashed into 
        the water. Shortly afterwards, Laurie Wickens and four of his friends contacted the Royal 
        Canadian Mounted Police after they spotted a large object floating in the Atlantic Ocean 
        about a 1,000 feet from shore.<br>

        The RCMP, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force became involved in an 
        unsuccessful recovery effort. The investigation revealed that all commercial, private and 
        military aircraft along the eastern seaboard were accounted for. The Navy combed the 
        seafloor of the Gulf of Maine, but found no trace of the object.
